# Class 02 reading files

Selecting the right editor can be make or break for a developer. You can potentially save hundreds of hours over the couse of your career with ease of life functions from a good editor. Depending on the individual and the preferences, will determine what editor they ultimately pick.

## Choosing a text editor
There are plenty of text editors to use. It seems like as long as you find one that is suitable for you and can get the job done, it is perfect. A text editor is one of the most important tools you can use as a web developer. A few important features are:
- Code completion
- Syntax highlighting
- A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye fatigue)
- The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions

## The Command Line
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

#### Basic Navigation

The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. It's one thing to know where we are. Next we'll want to know what is there. The command for this task is ls. It's short for list. There are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative. Whenever we refer to a file or directory we are using one of these paths. Whenever we refer to a file or directory, we can, in fact, use either type of path (either way, the system will still be directed to the same location).

To begin with, we have to understand that the file system under linux is a hierarchical structure. At the very top of the structure is what's called the root directory. It is denoted by a single slash ( / ). It has subdirectories, they have subdirectories and so on. Files may reside in any of these directories.

In order to move around in the system we use a command called cd which stands for change directory.

#### About Files

Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them. As you would remember, a space on the command line is how we seperate items. They are how we know what is the program name and can identify each command line argument.

###### Quotes 

The first approach involves using quotes around the entire item. You may use either single or double quotes (later on we will see that there is a subtle difference between the two but for now that difference is not a problem). Anything inside quotes is considered a single item.

##### Escape Characters

Another method is to use what is called an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). What the backslash does is escape (or nullify) the special meaning of the next character.

file - obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

ls -a - List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
