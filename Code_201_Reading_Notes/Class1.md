To be or not to be an HTTP request, sending copies and copies from client to server using TCP/IP.
To be a server taking messages from the client, sending back the data packets that they so desired.

The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any \<link>-element references to external CSS stylesheets and any \<script>-element references to scripts.
As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from \<link> elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from \<script> elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.

To find images for a website, there are plenty of sites that offer royalty free and stock photos to use.

strings have either single or double quotes surrounding them, while numbers do not have quotes around them.

Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable

### Introduction to HTML

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.

The anatomy of our element is:

- The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
- The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
- The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.

\<article> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).
\<section> is similar to \<article>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme. It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break \<article>s up into different \<section>s, or \<section>s up into different \<article>s, depending on the context.

head, header, main, footer are typical elements in html

Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document â€” the <meta> element. Of course, the other stuff we are talking about in this article could also be thought of as metadata too. There are a lot of different types of <meta> elements that can be included in your page's <head>, but we won't try to explain them all at this stage, as it would just get too confusing. Instead, we'll explain a few things that you might commonly see, just to give you an idea.[-1]

### How to start to design a website

When starting with a web project, many people focus on the technical side. Of course you must be familiar with the technique of your craft, but what really matters is what you want to accomplish. Yes, it seems obvious, but too many projects fail not from a lack of technical know-how, but from lack of goals and vision.

So when you get an idea and want to turn it into a website, there are a few questions you should answer before anything else:

- What exactly do I want to accomplish?
- How will a website help me reach my goals?
- What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

All of this is called project ideation and is a necessary first step to reach your goal, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer.

### Semantics

In HTML, for example, the \<h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page. On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top level heading with \<span>.

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings 
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is arguably more difficult to learn than related technologies such as HTML and CSS. Before attempting to learn JavaScript, you are strongly advised to get familiar with at least these two technologies first, and perhaps others as well. Start by working through the following modules

You can add JavaScript to HTML with script tags
