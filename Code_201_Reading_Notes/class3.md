## Ordered and Unordered lists

The \<ul> element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square.

With CSS using list-style-type

The \<ol> and \<ul> elements both represent a list of items. The difference is with the \<ol> element, the order is meaningful. For example:

Steps in a recipe
Turn-by-turn directions
The list of ingredients in decreasing proportion on nutrition information labels
To determine which list to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning changes, use the \<ol> element â€” otherwise you can use \<ul>.

You can change the list type by using the start attribute or the type attribute.

## The Box Model

The Box Model: While the margin was driving down the road staying within the lanes, the padding was safe inside the car being protected by the other shell.

## Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

you can add numbers, strings, booleons, objects, other arrays.

Yes the array people is valid, you can access the values stored using index.

|Name|Shorthand operator| Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|
|Assignment	|x = f()|x = f()
|Addition assignment|	x += f()|x = x + f()
|Subtraction assignment|	x -= f()	|x = x - f()
|Multiplication assignment|	x *= f()	|x = x * f()
|Division assignment|	x /= f()	|x = x / f()

the result would be "10dog", this is because c is a boolean and connot be added or subtracted. It just has a value of true or false, and since you can add numbers and strings in JS it becomes one full string resulting in "10dog"

you would use a conditional if you were checking a guest list for a party.

when you are iterating though a list or you have a finite number of tries, you would use a loop until you have exhausted your attempts or find what you are looking for.
