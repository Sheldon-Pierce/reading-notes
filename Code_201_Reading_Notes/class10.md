## Types of Errors

Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:

- Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
- Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.
Okay, so it's not quite that simple — there are some other differentiators as you drill down deeper. But the above classifications will do at this early stage in your career. We'll look at both of these types going forward.

Most of my errors were within the JS and essentially i would have functions that would not return any values so basically what I had to do was store the numbers the functions wer returning into some kind of array.

Once I learn what problems produce what errors, it should be easier to determine what I need to do to fix the problems I encounter.

## JSDebugger

It allows you to move step by step through a problem and find teh exact location of where you start to encounter problems.


The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
