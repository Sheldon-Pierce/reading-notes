# Class 1

## Pain vs. Suffering

I am looking forward to this class. As I mentioned in my intro to the class, python was actually the first language that I taught myself and I am looking forward to coding with it again. I have already made a few projects and I look forward to working with new poeple in this aspect. I can already imagine the amount of pain this class will put me through, but I am also thankful for the experience and I look forward to my growth and experience at the end of the ride!

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

O(NÂ²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
