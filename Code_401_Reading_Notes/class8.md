# Python List Comprehension:

The basic syntax of a Python list comprehension is as follows:

[expression for item in iterable if condition]

- expression is the operation to be performed on each item in the iterable.

- item represents each individual element in the iterable.

- iterable is a collection of items that can be iterated over, such as a list, tuple, or string.

- condition is an optional expression that filters the items that are returned based on a certain condition.

List comprehension is a concise way to create a new list by performing some operation on each item in an iterable, compared to using a for loop to create a list. It can simplify the code and make it more readable.

# Decorators in Python:

In Python, a decorator is a special kind of function that can be used to modify or enhance the behavior of another function or class. Decorators are defined using the @decorator_name syntax, where decorator_name is the name of the decorator function.

Decorators work by wrapping the original function or class inside another function that provides some additional functionality, such as logging, profiling, or error handling. This can be useful for separating concerns and keeping code modular and reusable.
