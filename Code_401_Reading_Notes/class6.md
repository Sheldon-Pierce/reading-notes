### The random() Function
The random() function in the python random module is used to generate random numbers between 0 and 1. When executed, the random() function returns a floating point number between 0 and 1.

If you want a larger number, you can multiply it by a larger value. For example, to create a random number between 0 and 100, you can multiply the output of the random() function by 100 as shown below.

import random
random.random() * 100

### The randint() Function in Python
The randint() function which is defined in the python random module can be used to create random strings within a range. The function takes two numbers as its input argument. The first input argument is the start of the range and the second input argument is the end of the range. After execution, the randint() function returns a random integer within the given range.

## Risk Analysis

The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

How to perform Risk Analysis?
- There are three steps:

    - Searching the risk

    - Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

    - Measures for the risk identified

## Testing

Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. Test coverage is of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are.

## Big O

Big O notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm by representing its worst-case time complexity. It is commonly used to measure how much time an algorithm takes to execute as its input size grows larger.

In Big O notation, the time complexity of an algorithm is represented as O(f(n)), where f(n) is a function that describes the growth rate of the algorithm's execution time relative to the size of the input, n. The "O" stands for "order of magnitude," and it represents the upper bound of the algorithm's time complexity.

An everyday task that demonstrates O(n) time complexity is searching for a specific item in an unsorted list. Making a grocery list, and then going to the store, seeing if you forgot anything on the list, and then checking each item on the list to make sure.
