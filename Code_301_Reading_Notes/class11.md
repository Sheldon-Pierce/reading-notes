| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| structured query language used for defining | unstructured query language |

SQL is good for transactional based data

NoSQL fits better with hierarchical data storage since it follows key-value pairs

NoSQL is best for hierarchical data storage

NoSQL is best for scalability

SQL - Structured Query Language

Realtional Database - stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

Tables

defines how data is organized within a relational database

NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.

This means a NoSQL JSON database can store and retrieve data using literally “no SQL.” Or you can combine the flexibility of JSON with the power of SQL for the best of both worlds.

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

In comparison to the SQL server, MongoDB is faster and more scalable.

One of the most frequently cited drawbacks of NoSQL databases is that they don't support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents.
